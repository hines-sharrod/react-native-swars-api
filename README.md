# Star Wars API React Native App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Project Overview

This is a React Native mobile application that demonstrates fundamental React Native development concepts through the exploration of the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). This project serves as a showcase of essential React Native knowledge, including working with APIs, managing application state, navigation, and creating a user-friendly mobile experience.

âœ¨ Key Features & React Native Fundamentals Showcased:
- Data Fetching and API Integration: Successfully fetches data from the Star Wars API, showcasing handling asynchronous data operations and integrating with external APIs.
- Component-Based Architecture: The application is built using React Native's core components like <View>, <Text>, <FlatList>, and <Image>, demonstrating a component-driven development approach.
- State Management: Effectively manages the application's state to dynamically render data, demonstrating an understanding of how to handle and update data within React Native components.
- Navigation: Implements navigation between different screens within the application, showcasing the ability to structure and navigate through a multi-screen mobile experience.
- User Interface (UI) Development: Creates a visually appealing and responsive user interface tailored for both Android and iOS platforms, demonstrating an understanding of React Native styling and layout principles.


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
